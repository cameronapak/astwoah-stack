# Tasks for BKND integration

### Primary

- [ ] Remove the Dashboard
- [ ] Make sure auth is guarded after initial start
- [ ] Add ability to target Turso db URL for PROD
- [ ] Figure out how to remove the anchor underlines in the admin
- [ ] After I sign in, redirect to the /admin page.
- [ ] Get Types working for BKND entities

### Secondary

- [ ] (optional) is there an Astro adapter for BKND?
- [ ] (nitpick) Given I tab when signing in from email to password, make it go to password and not forgot password
