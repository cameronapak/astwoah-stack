# Freedom Stack Vision

## Dream

I dream of a Tiny, Open, Portable, and Secure stack to create web apps _(web apps that can easily even easily become mobile apps)_.

Web App Criteria:

- A Vanilla Web Framework
- Authentication & User Management
- Database
- Emails
- File Storage
- Payments/Subscriptions
- Easy Deployment

Mobile App Criteria:

- PWA support out of the box
- Works with SSR multi-page sites
- Communicates with native API's

While we're not there yet, we will get there one day at a time, one contribution at a time.

## A Vanilla Web Framework

When using an HTML-first, vanilla web framework, it makes it easy for the code to be copied, pasted, and re-used easily, without it quickly being outdated.

I chose [Astro](https://astro.build). Astro feels like vanilla web development with the power of components, SSR, middleware, and API's.

Astro has little overhead to learn compared to other frameworks like the React-based Next.js.

## Authentication & User Management

The easiest and fastest way to implement auth and user management in Astro is to use [Clerk](https://clerk.com/).

I initially used Clerk because of its ease of use and its generous free tier.

It worked. It was incredible. But... it semi-defied the pier of needing to be portable.

Well, what defines portable?

I can pick it up and move it elsewhere easily.
