const letterContentMarkdown = `
  I dream of a lightweight, simple web development stack that invokes a fun web experience at the cheapest possible
  maintenance, backend, and server cost. As close to free as possible. I wanted to provide a stack that's powerful
  like Ruby on Rails _("The One Person Framework")_, but with the ease and "vanilla" web dev feel of Astro. Freedom
  Stack is built on three core principles:

  - **Approachable** â€” Making web development feel natural and comfortable, especially for newcomers
  - **Flow-able** â€” Using an HTML-first approach that helps you focus and get in the zone faster
  - **Pocket-friendly** â€” Keeping it financially maintainable for everyone, from indie hackers to startups

  This is only the beginning. It's a joy to work on this project and to give it freely. Long story short, I was
  bed-ridden sick for about 7 months, not knowing if I'd make it out. [God](https://www.gotquestions.org/what-is-the-gospel.html)
  took care of me through friends and family. He healed me on the inside before he healed me on the outside. Ever
  since, I've had a deep desire to create digital experiences that lead to freedom. May Freedom Stack be a blessing
  to you to create whatever dreams and visions on your heart and mind.

  Freedom Stack:

  - Feels vanilla, with the power of modern frameworks. No need for Docker. Just throw it on Netlify and you're good to go.
  - Is built with Astro, Alpine.js, HTMX, Astro DB, Better Auth, Preline UI, daisyUI, & Lucide Icons. Enjoy building apps.
  - Has a low barrier to entry, making it easy to learn and start building fast. Get in the zone and stay in it.
